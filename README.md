# Stepper Motor Tracking a Rotary 360 Degree Dial

A simple example of using a rotary dial (360 degree) being tracked by a stepper motor (28BYJ-48)

Cobbled together from a variety of examples to learn how to drive a stepper motor and use a rotary dial.

Hardware:
- Stepper motor: 5v 28BYJ-48
- Motor Driver: ULN2003 with breakout board
- Rotary Dial: Common 360 degree continuous rotation with breadboard headers
- Processor: Arduino Uno 328p
